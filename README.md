# Navya Real Estate Management System

A **console-based Real Estate Management System** built in Java. This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, file handling, collections, and a menu-driven user interface with full data persistence.

## 🚀 Features
- Add new properties
- View, search (by address), update price, and delete properties
- Mark properties as **Sold** or **Available Again**
- Complete transaction history tracking
- Data saved automatically to text files (`properties.txt` & `history.txt`)
- Strong input validation (no crashes on invalid input)
- Prevents duplicate Property IDs
- Simple admin login for security

**Default Login Credentials**  
Username: `admin`  
Password: `admin123`

## 🛠️ OOP Concepts Demonstrated
- **Encapsulation** – Private fields with getters/setters
- **Polymorphism** – Overriding `toString()` for clean output
- **Abstraction** – Menu system hides complex logic
- **Collections** – `ArrayList` for dynamic storage of properties and history

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Make sure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)
2. Open terminal/command prompt in the project folder
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac RealEstateManagement.java
   ```
